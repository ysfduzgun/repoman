# repoman
Repoman is a lightweight and user-friendly tool managing Debian repos and mirroring other Debian based repos effortless.
It uses the APTLY API, is easy to install, works on any distribution, and is meant to run locally, so security isnâ€™t a primary focus.
It can operate without an internet connection after installation.
